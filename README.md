# Dummy VNFManager Amqp
The Dummy-VNFManager-Amqp imitates the behaviour of a real VNFManager. For the communication with the NFVO it uses AMQP.  
If you use the Dummy-VNFManager-Amqp for deploying a network service it will not create any resources. 
When the NFVO sends commands to the Dummy-VNFManager-Amqp, it will answer as if it executed them although it actually did not. 
In this way Openbaton can be tested without actually deploying anything. 

# Technical Requirements

In order to execute the dummy-vnfm-amqp, you need to have a running and configured NFVO. 

# How to install the Dummy VNFManager Amqp from source code

Git clone the project into the /opt/openbaton directory (you may need to be logged in as root user, unless you change the permissions on the /opt/openbaton folder): 

```bash
mkdir /opt/openbaton
git clone https://github.com/openbaton/dummy-vnfm-amqp.git
```

And Execute 
```bash
cd /opt/openbaton/dummy-vnfm-amqp; ./dummy-vnfm.sh compile
```
to compile it. 

# How to use the Dummy VNFManager Amqp

To start the Dummy-VNFM-Amqp execute
 ```bash
 cd /opt/openbaton/dummy-vnfm-amqp;./dummy-vnfm.sh start
 ```

This will create a new screen window which you can access using *screen -x openbaton*.  
If you want to run the Dummy VNFManager Amqp on another machine than on which rabbitmq is running you first have to configure it.  
Either you use the *application.properties* file in the project's resources folder to configure it or you create the file 
*/etc/openbaton/dummy-vnfm-amqp.properties*, copy the previously mentioned *application.properties* file's content into it 
and configure it there.  
Then change the properties *spring.rabbitmq.host* and *spring.rabbitmq.port* to the ip address and host on which rabbitmq are running.  
If you decided to create the file */etc/openbaton/dummy-vnfm-amqp.properties* the Dummy VNFManager Amqp will only use this one so make sure 
that all the properties from the file *application.properties* are present.  
To use the Dummy-VNFManager-Amqp for "deploying" a network service you have to store a VimInstance with type *test* in the NFVO 
and the Virtual Network Function Descriptors used to describe the network service have to define their *endpoint* as *test*. 

# How to extend the Dummy VNFManager Amqp

If you want the Dummy VNFManager Amqp to behave differently you can change it's behaviour in the DummyAMQPVNFManager.java class.
In this class all the methods are defined that will be executed by a VNFM while deploying a network service.

# What is Open Baton?

OpenBaton is an open source project providing a comprehensive implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO) specification.

Open Baton is a ETSI NFV MANO compliant framework. Open Baton was part of the OpenSDNCore (www.opensdncore.org) project started almost three years ago by Fraunhofer FOKUS with the objective of providing a compliant implementation of the ETSI NFV specification. 

Open Baton is easily extensible. It integrates with OpenStack, and provides a plugin mechanism for supporting additional VIM types. It supports Network Service management either using a generic VNFM or interoperating with VNF-specific VNFM. It uses different mechanisms (REST or PUB/SUB) for interoperating with the VNFMs. It integrates with additional components for the runtime management of a Network Service. For instance, it provides autoscaling and fault management based on monitoring information coming from the monitoring system available at the NFVI level.
